Course Overview and Schedule

By taking this Framework Fundamentals with Angular course, you’ll learn how to begin programming with Angular, which is a complete JavaScript-based open-source client and server-side web application framework that allows you to use HTML as your template language. You’ll also learn the basics of Angular’s module definition and how to perform basic dependency injection between components.

Students

This course is best suited for anyone wanting to learn the basics of working with the Angular framework who already has some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript training or knowledge.

Schedule

Framework Fundamentals with Angular is a self-paced course that consists of five modules. All five of the modules are available when the course begins, and you can work your way through the modules at your own pace (the course will close after about 5 months).

While each student will complete this course at their own pace, we anticipate that an average student will be able to complete the core lab assignments in about 10-15 hours (averaging 2-3 hours per module). We recommend that you attempt to complete one module per week, and rather than pushing on to the next module, that you allocate any additional study time that you have (for a particular week) to exploring suggested resources and experimenting with what you've learned during the labs. A slower or faster pace may work well for some students, but we believe that this approach will be affective for most students.

Module Structure

The initial section in each of the modules (the Resource Content section) includes a collection of topic area documentation and links to additional resources. We suggest that you take the time to read through the contents of the documentation section, especially if you are not familiar with the topic areas for a particular module. After reviewing the documents in the resource content section, you will work your way through a series of tutorial style labs that guide you step-by-step through the implementation of tasks associated with the topics areas for that module. The final lab for each module is a self-assessment lab. This self-assessment lab provides you with the opportunity to evaluate what you have learned during the module. Rather than showing you how to implement the solution, this lab challenges you apply the techniques that you learned during the tutorial labs. We highly recommend that you spend the time necessary to complete each of the self-assessment labs.

Tutorial Labs

Each module contains a series of tutorial lab assignments. These labs guide you step-by-step through an implementation scenario, and provide you with an explanation of what you are accomplishing as well as why it is important. This is your opportunity to gain experience implementing a particular technology.

Some assessment questions will be presented during the tutorial labs.

Self-Assessment Labs

After completing the tutorial labs for a given module, you are assigned a self-assessment lab. The self-assessment lab gives you a chance to evaluate how well you have retained the skills that you learned while completing the tutorial labs.

Some assessment questions will be presented during the self-assessment lab.
